         * + `COUNT` - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves.
         * + `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns only the attributes listed in `ProjectionExpression`. This return value is equivalent to specifying `ProjectionExpression` without specifying any value for `Select`.If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation reads only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency.If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table.
         *
         * If neither `Select` nor `ProjectionExpression` are specified, DynamoDB defaults to `ALL_ATTRIBUTES` when accessing a table, and `ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES` when accessing an index. You cannot use both `Select` and `ProjectionExpression` together in a single request, unless the value for `Select` is `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES`. (This usage is equivalent to specifying `ProjectionExpression` without any value for `Select`.)
         *
         * If you use the `ProjectionExpression` parameter, then the value for `Select` can only be `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES`. Any other value for `Select` will return an error.
