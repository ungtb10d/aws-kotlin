/**
 * The entire transaction request was canceled.
 * DynamoDB cancels a TransactWriteItems request under the following
 * circumstances:
 * A condition in one of the condition expressions is not met.
 * A table in the TransactWriteItems request is in a different
 * account or region.
 * More than one action in the TransactWriteItems operation
 * targets the same item.
 * There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be
 * completed.
 * An item size becomes too large (larger than 400 KB), or a local secondary
 * index (LSI) becomes too large, or a similar validation error occurs because of
 * changes made by the transaction.
 * There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.
 * DynamoDB cancels a TransactGetItems request under the
 * following circumstances:
 * There is an ongoing TransactGetItems operation that conflicts
 * with a concurrent PutItem, UpdateItem,
 * DeleteItem or TransactWriteItems request. In this
 * case the TransactGetItems operation fails with a
 * TransactionCanceledException.
 * A table in the TransactGetItems request is in a different
 * account or region.
 * There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be
 * completed.
 * There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.
 * If using Java, DynamoDB lists the cancellation reasons on the
 * CancellationReasons property. This property is not set for other
 * languages. Transaction cancellation reasons are ordered in the order of requested
 * items, if an item has no error it will have NONE code and
 * Null message.
 * Cancellation reason codes and possible error messages:
 * No Errors:
 * Code: NONE
 * Message: null
 * Conditional Check Failed:
 * Code: ConditionalCheckFailed
 * Message: The conditional request failed.
 * Item Collection Size Limit Exceeded:
 * Code: ItemCollectionSizeLimitExceeded
 * Message: Collection size exceeded.
 * Transaction Conflict:
 * Code: TransactionConflict
 * Message: Transaction is ongoing for the item.
 * Provisioned Throughput Exceeded:
 * Code: ProvisionedThroughputExceeded
 * Messages:
 * The level of configured provisioned throughput for the
 * table was exceeded. Consider increasing your provisioning level
 * with the UpdateTable API.
 * This Message is received when provisioned throughput is
 * exceeded is on a provisioned DynamoDB
 * table.
 * The level of configured provisioned throughput for one or
 * more global secondary indexes of the table was exceeded.
 * Consider increasing your provisioning level for the
 * under-provisioned global secondary indexes with the UpdateTable
 * API.
 * This message is returned when provisioned throughput is
 * exceeded is on a provisioned GSI.
 * Throttling Error:
 * Code: ThrottlingError
 * Messages:
 * Throughput exceeds the current capacity of your table or
 * index. DynamoDB is automatically scaling your table or
 * index so please try again shortly. If exceptions persist, check
 * if you have a hot key:
 * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-partition-key-design.html.
 * This message is returned when writes get throttled on an
 * On-Demand table as DynamoDB is automatically
 * scaling the table.
 * Throughput exceeds the current capacity for one or more
 * global secondary indexes. DynamoDB is automatically
 * scaling your index so please try again shortly.
 * This message is returned when when writes get throttled on
 * an On-Demand GSI as DynamoDB is automatically
 * scaling the GSI.
 * Validation Error:
 * Code: ValidationError
 * Messages:
 * One or more parameter values were invalid.
 * The update expression attempted to update the secondary
 * index key beyond allowed size limits.
 * The update expression attempted to update the secondary
 * index key to unsupported type.
 * An operand in the update expression has an incorrect data
 * type.
 * Item size to update has exceeded the maximum allowed
 * size.
 * Number overflow. Attempting to store a number with
 * magnitude larger than supported range.
 * Type mismatch for attribute to update.
 * Nesting Levels have exceeded supported limits.
 * The document path provided in the update expression is
 * invalid for update.
 * The provided expression refers to an attribute that does
 * not exist in the item.
