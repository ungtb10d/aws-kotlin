/**
 * Represents a condition to be compared with an attribute value. This condition can be
 * used with DeleteItem, PutItem, or UpdateItem
 * operations; if the comparison evaluates to true, the operation succeeds; if not, the
 * operation fails. You can use ExpectedAttributeValue in one of two different
 * ways:
 * Use AttributeValueList to specify one or more values to compare
 * against an attribute. Use ComparisonOperator to specify how you
 * want to perform the comparison. If the comparison evaluates to true, then the
 * conditional operation succeeds.
 * Use Value to specify a value that DynamoDB will compare against
 * an attribute. If the values match, then ExpectedAttributeValue
 * evaluates to true and the conditional operation succeeds. Optionally, you can
 * also set Exists to false, indicating that you do
 * not expect to find the attribute value in the table. In this
 * case, the conditional operation succeeds only if the comparison evaluates to
 * false.
 * Value and Exists are incompatible with
 * AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator. Note that if
 * you use both sets of parameters at once, DynamoDB will return a
 * ValidationException exception.

     * The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.

     * AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue
     * element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set.
     * If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type
     * than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example,

     * "1"&#93;}.
     * NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types,
     * including lists and maps.
     * AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue
     * of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an
     * item contains an AttributeValue of a different type than the one
     * provided in the request, the value does not match. For example,
     * {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also,
     * {"N":"6"} does not equal {"NS":&#91;"6", "2",
     * "1"&#93;}.
     * LE : Less than or equal.
     * AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue
     * element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains
     * an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided
     * in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"}
     * does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not
     * compare to {"NS":&#91;"6", "2", "1"&#93;}.
     * LT : Less than.
     * AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue
     * of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an
     * AttributeValue element of a different type than the one
     * provided in the request, the value does not match. For example,

     * does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not
     * compare to {"NS":&#91;"6", "2", "1"&#93;}.
     * NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported
     * for all data types, including lists and maps.
     * This operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its data type.
     * If the data type of attribute "a" is null, and you evaluate it
     * using NOT_NULL, the result is a Boolean true. This
     * result is because the attribute "a" exists; its data type is
     * not relevant to the NOT_NULL comparison operator.
     * NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported
     * for all data types, including lists and maps.
     * This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data
     * type. If the data type of attribute "a" is null, and you
     * evaluate it using NULL, the result is a Boolean
     * false. This is because the attribute "a"
     * exists; its data type is not relevant to the NULL comparison
     * operator.
     * CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.
     * AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue
     * element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target
     * attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a
     * substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary,
     * then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input.
     * If the target attribute of the comparison is a set ("SS",
     * "NS", or "BS"), then the operator evaluates to
     * true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set.
     * CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "a CONTAINS b",
     * "a" can be a list; however, "b" cannot be a set, a
     * map, or a list.
     * NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a
     * value in a set.
     * AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue
     * element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target
     * attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the
     * absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is
     * Binary, then the operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target
     * that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set
     * ("SS", "NS", or "BS"), then the
     * operator evaluates to true if it does not find an exact
     * match with any member of the set.
     * NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "a NOT CONTAINS
     * b", "a" can be a list; however, "b" cannot
     * be a set, a map, or a list.
     * BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix.
     * AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue
     * of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of
     * the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set
     * type).
     * IN : Checks for matching elements in a list.
     * AttributeValueList can contain one or more
     * AttributeValue elements of type String, Number, or Binary.
     * These attributes are compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any
     * elements of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression evaluates
     * to true.
     * BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than
     * or equal to the second value.
     * AttributeValueList must contain two AttributeValue
     * elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A
     * target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the
     * first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item
