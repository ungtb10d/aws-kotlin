/**
 * # Amazon DynamoDB
 * Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.
 *
 * With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics.
 *
 * DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability.

     * The `BatchGetItem` operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key.
     *
     * A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. `BatchGetItem` returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for `UnprocessedKeys`. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get.
     *
     * If you request more than 100 items, `BatchGetItem` returns a `ValidationException` with the message "Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call."
     *
     * For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate `UnprocessedKeys` value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset.
     *
     * If *none* of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then `BatchGetItem` returns a `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. If *at least one* of the items is successfully processed, then `BatchGetItem` completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in `UnprocessedKeys`.
     *
     * If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm*. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.
     *
     * For more information, see [Batch Operations and Error Handling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#BatchOperations) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
     *
     * By default, `BatchGetItem` performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set `ConsistentRead` to `true` for any or all tables.
     *
     * In order to minimize response latency, `BatchGetItem` retrieves items in parallel.
     *
     * When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the `ProjectionExpression` parameter.
     *
     * If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read. For more information, see [Working with Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html#CapacityUnitCalculations) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

     * The `BatchWriteItem` operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to `BatchWriteItem` can transmit up to 16MB of data over the network, consisting of up to 25 item put or delete operations. While individual items can be up to 400 KB once stored, it's important to note that an item's representation might be greater than 400KB while being sent in DynamoDB's JSON format for the API call. For more details on this distinction, see [Naming Rules and Data Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html).
     *
     * `BatchWriteItem` cannot update items. To update items, use the `UpdateItem` action.
     *
     * The individual `PutItem` and `DeleteItem` operations specified in `BatchWriteItem` are atomic; however `BatchWriteItem` as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the `UnprocessedItems` response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call `BatchWriteItem` in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new `BatchWriteItem` request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.
     *
     * If *none* of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then `BatchWriteItem` returns a `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`.
     *
     * If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm*. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables.

     * For more information, see [Batch Operations and Error Handling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#Programming.Errors.BatchOperations) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
     *
     * With `BatchWriteItem`, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, `BatchWriteItem` does not behave in the same way as individual `PutItem` and `DeleteItem` calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and `BatchWriteItem` does not return deleted items in the response.
     *
     * If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, `BatchWriteItem` performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application.
     *
     * Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit.
     *
     * If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:
     * + One or more tables specified in the `BatchWriteItem` request does not exist.
     * + Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.
     * + You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same `BatchWriteItem` request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same `BatchWriteItem` request.
     * +  Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys (which essentially is two put operations).
     * + There are more than 25 requests in the batch.
     * + Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.
     * + The total request size exceeds 16 MB.

     * Returns the current provisioned-capacity quotas for your Amazon Web Services account in a Region, both for the Region as a whole and for any one DynamoDB table that you create there.
     *
     * When you establish an Amazon Web Services account, the account has initial quotas on the maximum read capacity units and write capacity units that you can provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a given Region. Also, there are per-table quotas that apply when you create a table there. For more information, see [Service, Account, and Table Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html) page in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
     *
     * Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at [Amazon Web Services Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/), obtaining the increase is not instantaneous. The `DescribeLimits` action lets you write code to compare the capacity you are currently using to those quotas imposed by your account so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a quota.
     *
     * For example, you could use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to do the following:
     * + Call `DescribeLimits` for a particular Region to obtain your current account quotas on provisioned capacity there.
     * + Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both.
     * + Call `ListTables` to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.
     * + For each table name listed by `ListTables`, do the following:
     *    + Call `DescribeTable` with the table name.
     *    + Use the data returned by `DescribeTable` to add the read capacity units and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to your variables.
     *    + If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your variables as well.
     * + Report the account quotas for that Region returned by `DescribeLimits`, along with the total current provisioned capacity levels you have calculated.
     *
     * This will let you see whether you are getting close to your account-level quotas.
     *
     * The per-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global secondary indexes.
     *
     * For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase provisioned capacity extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies is that the aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account quotas.

 * The `BatchGetItem` operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key.
 *
 * A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. `BatchGetItem` returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for `UnprocessedKeys`. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get.
 *
 * If you request more than 100 items, `BatchGetItem` returns a `ValidationException` with the message "Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call."
 *
 * For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate `UnprocessedKeys` value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset.
 *
 * If *none* of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then `BatchGetItem` returns a `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. If *at least one* of the items is successfully processed, then `BatchGetItem` completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in `UnprocessedKeys`.
 *
 * If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm*. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.
 *
 * For more information, see [Batch Operations and Error Handling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#BatchOperations) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
 *
 * By default, `BatchGetItem` performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set `ConsistentRead` to `true` for any or all tables.
 *
 * In order to minimize response latency, `BatchGetItem` retrieves items in parallel.
 *
 * When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the `ProjectionExpression` parameter.
 *
 * If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read.

A single call to `BatchWriteItem` can transmit up to 16MB of data over the network, consisting of up to 25 item put or delete operations. While individual items can be up to 400 KB once stored, it's important to note that an item's representation might be greater than 400KB while being sent in DynamoDB's JSON format for the API call. For more details on this distinction, see [Naming Rules and Data Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html).
 *
 * `BatchWriteItem` cannot update items. To update items, use the `UpdateItem` action.
 *
 * The individual `PutItem` and `DeleteItem` operations specified in `BatchWriteItem` are atomic; however `BatchWriteItem` as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the `UnprocessedItems` response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call `BatchWriteItem` in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new `BatchWriteItem` request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.
 *
 * If *none* of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then `BatchWriteItem` returns a `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`.
 *
 * If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm*. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables.

 * For more information, see [Batch Operations and Error Handling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#Programming.Errors.BatchOperations) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
 *
 * With `BatchWriteItem`, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, `BatchWriteItem` does not behave in the same way as individual `PutItem` and `DeleteItem` calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and `BatchWriteItem` does not return deleted items in the response.
 *
 * If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, `BatchWriteItem` performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application.
 *
 * Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit.
 *
 * If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:
 * + One or more tables specified in the `BatchWriteItem` request does not exist.
 * + Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.
 * + You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same `BatchWriteItem` request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same `BatchWriteItem` request.
 * +  Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys (which essentially is two put operations).
 * + There are more than 25 requests in the batch.
 * + Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.

 *
 * For example, you could use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to do the following:
 * + Call `DescribeLimits` for a particular Region to obtain your current account quotas on provisioned capacity there.
 * + Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both.

 * Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item that has the same primary key as the new item already exists in the specified table, the new item completely replaces the existing item. You can perform a conditional put operation (add a new item if one with the specified primary key doesn't exist), or replace an existing item if it has certain attribute values. You can return the item's attribute values in the same operation, using the `ReturnValues` parameter.
 *
 * When you add an item, the primary key attributes are the only required attributes. Attribute values cannot be null.
 *
 * Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute values of type String and Binary must have a length greater than zero if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index. Set type attributes cannot be empty.
 *
 * Invalid Requests with empty values will be rejected with a `ValidationException` exception.
 *
 * To prevent a new item from replacing an existing item, use a conditional expression that contains the `attribute_not_exists` function with the name of the attribute being used as the partition key for the table. Since every record must contain that attribute, the `attribute_not_exists` function will only succeed if no matching item exists.

/**
 * You must provide the name of the partition key attribute and a single value for that attribute. `Query` returns all items with that partition key value. Optionally, you can provide a sort key attribute and use a comparison operator to refine the search results.
 *
 * Use the `KeyConditionExpression` parameter to provide a specific value for the partition key. The `Query` operation will return all of the items from the table or index with that partition key value. You can optionally narrow the scope of the `Query` operation by specifying a sort key value and a comparison operator in `KeyConditionExpression`. To further refine the `Query` results, you can optionally provide a `FilterExpression`. A `FilterExpression` determines which items within the results should be returned to you. All of the other results are discarded.
 *
 *  A `Query` operation always returns a result set. If no matching items are found, the result set will be empty. Queries that do not return results consume the minimum number of read capacity units for that type of read operation.
 *
 *  DynamoDB calculates the number of read capacity units consumed based on item size, not on the amount of data that is returned to an application. The number of capacity units consumed will be the same whether you request all of the attributes (the default behavior) or just some of them (using a projection expression). The number will also be the same whether or not you use a `FilterExpression`.
 *
 * `Query` results are always sorted by the sort key value. If the data type of the sort key is Number, the results are returned in numeric order; otherwise, the results are returned in order of UTF-8 bytes. By default, the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, set the `ScanIndexForward` parameter to false.
 *
 *  A single `Query` operation will read up to the maximum number of items set (if using the `Limit` parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then apply any filtering to the results using `FilterExpression`. If `LastEvaluatedKey` is present in the response, you will need to paginate the result set. For more information, see [Paginating the Results](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.html#Query.Pagination) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
 *
 * `FilterExpression` is applied after a `Query` finishes, but before the results are returned. A `FilterExpression` cannot contain partition key or sort key attributes. You need to specify those attributes in the `KeyConditionExpression`.
 *
 *  A `Query` operation can return an empty result set and a `LastEvaluatedKey` if all the items read for the page of results are filtered out.
 *
 * You can query a table, a local secondary index, or a global secondary index. For a query on a table or on a local secondary index, you can set the `ConsistentRead` parameter to `true` and obtain a strongly consistent result. Global secondary indexes support eventually consistent reads only, so do not specify `ConsistentRead` when querying a global secondary index.
