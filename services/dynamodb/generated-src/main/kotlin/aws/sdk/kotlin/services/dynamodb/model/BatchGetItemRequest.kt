class BatchGetItemRequest private constructor(builder: Builder) {
    /**
     * A map of one or more table names and, for each table, a map that describes one or more
     * items to retrieve from that table. Each table name can be used only once per
     * BatchGetItem request.
     * Each element in the map of items to retrieve consists of the following:
     * ConsistentRead - If true, a strongly consistent read
     * is used; if false (the default), an eventually consistent read is
     * used.
     * ExpressionAttributeNames - One or more substitution tokens for
     * attribute names in the ProjectionExpression parameter. The
     * following are some use cases for using
     * ExpressionAttributeNames:
     * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved
     * word.
     * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name
     * in an expression.
     * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
     * misinterpreted in an expression.
     * Use the # character in an expression to
     * dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute
     * name:
     * Percentile
     * The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be
     * used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see
     * <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ReservedWords.html">Reserved
     * Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide).
     * To work around this, you could specify the following for
     * ExpressionAttributeNames:
     * {"#P":"Percentile"}
     * You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
     * example:
     * #P = :val
     * Tokens that begin with the : character
     * are expression attribute values, which are placeholders
     * for the actual value at runtime.
     * For more information about expression attribute names, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.AccessingItemAttributes.html">Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB
     * Developer Guide.
     * Keys - An array of primary key attribute values that define
     * specific items in the table. For each primary key, you must provide
     * all of the key attributes. For example, with a simple
     * primary key, you only need to provide the partition key value. For a composite
     * key, you must provide both the partition key value and the
     * sort key value.
     * ProjectionExpression - A string that identifies one or more
     * attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can include scalars,
     * sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be
     * separated by commas.
     * If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes are returned. If any
     * of the requested attributes are not found, they do not appear in the
     * result.
     * For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.AccessingItemAttributes.html">Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB
     * Developer Guide.
     * AttributesToGet - This is a legacy parameter. Use
     * ProjectionExpression instead. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.AttributesToGet.html">AttributesToGet in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer
     * Guide.
