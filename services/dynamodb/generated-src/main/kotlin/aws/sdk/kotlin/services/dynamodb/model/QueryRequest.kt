     * You can optionally use the `ExpressionAttributeNames` parameter to replace the names of the partition key and sort key with placeholder tokens. This option might be necessary if an attribute name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.

This return value is equivalent to specifying `ProjectionExpression` without specifying any value for `Select`.If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation will read only the index and not the table.

         *
         * Use the `ExpressionAttributeValues` parameter to replace tokens such as `:partitionval` and `:sortval` with actual values at runtime.
         *
         * You can optionally use the `ExpressionAttributeNames` parameter to replace the names of the partition key and sort key with placeholder tokens. This option might be necessary if an attribute name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word. For example, the following `KeyConditionExpression` parameter causes an error because *Size* is a reserved word:
         * + `Size = :myval`
         *
         * To work around this, define a placeholder (such a `#S`) to represent the attribute name *Size*. `KeyConditionExpression` then is as follows:
         * + `#S = :myval`
         *
