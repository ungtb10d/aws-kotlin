        /**
         * The condition that specifies the key values for items to be retrieved by the
         * Query action.
         * The condition must perform an equality test on a single partition key value.
         * The condition can optionally perform one of several comparison tests on a single sort
         * key value. This allows Query to retrieve one item with a given partition
         * key value and sort key value, or several items that have the same partition key value
         * but different sort key values.
         * The partition key equality test is required, and must be specified in the following
         * format:
         * partitionKeyName
         * =
         * :partitionkeyval
         * If you also want to provide a condition for the sort key, it must be combined using
         * AND with the condition for the sort key. Following is an example, using
         * the = comparison operator for the sort key:
         * partitionKeyName
         * =
         * :partitionkeyval
         * AND
         * sortKeyName
         * =
         * :sortkeyval
         * Valid comparisons for the sort key condition are as follows:
         * sortKeyName
         * =
         * :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is equal to
         * :sortkeyval.
         * sortKeyName
         * <
         * :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than
         * :sortkeyval.
         * sortKeyName
         * <=
         * :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than or equal to
         * :sortkeyval.
         * sortKeyName
         * >
         * :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than
         * :sortkeyval.
         * sortKeyName
         * >=
         * :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal
         * to :sortkeyval.
         * sortKeyName
         * BETWEEN
         * :sortkeyval1
         * AND
         * :sortkeyval2 - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal
         * to :sortkeyval1, and less than or equal to
         * :sortkeyval2.
         * begins_with (
         * sortKeyName, :sortkeyval
         * ) - true if the sort key value begins with a particular operand.
         * (You cannot use this function with a sort key that is of type Number.) Note that
         * the function name begins_with is case-sensitive.
         * Use the ExpressionAttributeValues parameter to replace tokens such as
         * :partitionval and :sortval with actual values at
         * runtime.
         * You can optionally use the ExpressionAttributeNames parameter to replace
         * the names of the partition key and sort key with placeholder tokens. This option might
         * be necessary if an attribute name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word. For example,
         * the following KeyConditionExpression parameter causes an error because
         * Size is a reserved word:
         * Size = :myval
         * To work around this, define a placeholder (such a #S) to represent the
         * attribute name Size. KeyConditionExpression then is as
         * follows:
         * #S = :myval
         * For a list of reserved words, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ReservedWords.html">Reserved Words
         * in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
