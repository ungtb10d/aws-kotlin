 * For the UpdateItem operation, represents the attributes to be modified,

class AttributeValueUpdate private constructor(builder: Builder) {
    /**
     * Specifies how to perform the update. Valid values are PUT (default),
     * DELETE, and ADD. The behavior depends on whether the
     * specified primary key already exists in the table.
     * If an item with the specified Key is found in
     * the table:
     * PUT - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the attribute
     * already exists, it is replaced by the new value.
     * DELETE - If no value is specified, the attribute and its value are
     * removed from the item. The data type of the specified value must match the
     * existing value's data type.
     * If a set of values is specified, then those values are
     * subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set
     * &#91;a,b,c&#93; and the DELETE action specified
     * &#91;a,c&#93;, then the final attribute value would be
     * &#91;b&#93;. Specifying an empty set is an error.
     * ADD - If the attribute does not already exist, then the attribute
     * and its values are added to the item. If the attribute does exist, then the
     * behavior of ADD depends on the data type of the attribute:
     * If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is
     * also a number, then the Value is mathematically added to
     * the existing attribute. If Value is a negative number, then
     * it is subtracted from the existing attribute.
     * If you use ADD to increment or decrement a number
     * value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB
     * uses 0 as the initial value.
     * In addition, if you use ADD to update an existing
     * item, and intend to increment or decrement an attribute value which
     * does not yet exist, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial
     * value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update does
     * not yet have an attribute named itemcount, but
     * you decide to ADD the number 3 to this
     * attribute anyway, even though it currently does not exist. DynamoDB
     * will create the itemcount attribute, set its
     * initial value to 0, and finally add 3 to
     * it. The result will be a new itemcount
     * attribute in the item, with a value of 3.
     * If the existing data type is a set, and if the Value is
     * also a set, then the Value is added to the existing set.
     * (This is a set operation, not mathematical
     * addition.) For example, if the attribute value was the set
     * &#91;1,2&#93;, and the ADD action specified
     * &#91;3&#93;, then the final attribute value would be
     * &#91;1,2,3&#93;. An error occurs if an Add action is specified
     * for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the
     * existing set type.
     * Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the
     * existing data type is a set of strings, the Value must also
     * be a set of strings. The same holds true for number sets and binary
     * sets.
     * This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is number
     * or is a set. Do not use ADD for any other data types.
     * If no item with the specified Key is
     * found:
     * PUT - DynamoDB creates a new item with the specified primary key,
     * and then adds the attribute.
     * DELETE - Nothing happens; there is no attribute to delete.
     * ADD - DynamoDB creates an item with the supplied primary key and
     * number (or set of numbers) for the attribute value. The only data types allowed
     * are number and number set; no other data types can be specified.
