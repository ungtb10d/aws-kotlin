     * The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration set for the role. The maximum session duration setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting or the administrator setting (whichever is lower), the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.
     *
     * Role chaining limits your Amazon Web Services CLI or Amazon Web Services API role session to a maximum of one hour. When you use the `AssumeRole` API operation to assume a role, you can specify the duration of your role session with the `DurationSeconds` parameter. You can specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12 hours), depending on the maximum session duration setting for your role. However, if you assume a role using role chaining and provide a `DurationSeconds` parameter value greater than one hour, the operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see [View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session) in the *IAM User Guide*.
     *
     * By default, the value is set to `3600` seconds.

     * The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a console session that you might request using the returned credentials. The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a `SessionDuration` parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session.
