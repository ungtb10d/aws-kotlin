     * instance-platform - The type of operating system for which the Capacity Reservation reserves capacity.
     * availability-zone - The Availability Zone of the Capacity Reservation.
     * tenancy - Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the
     * following tenancy settings:
     * default - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.
     * dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single Amazon Web Services account.
     * outpost-arn - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost on which the Capacity Reservation was created.
     * state - The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can be in one of the following states:
     * active- The Capacity Reservation is active and the capacity is available for your use.
     * expired - The Capacity Reservation expired automatically at the date and time specified in your request.
     * The reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.
     * cancelled - The Capacity Reservation was cancelled. The reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.
     * pending - The Capacity Reservation request was successful but the capacity provisioning is still pending.
     * failed - The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A request might fail due to invalid request parameters,
     * capacity constraints, or instance limit constraints. Failed requests are retained for 60 minutes.
     * start-date - The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was started.
     * end-date - The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is
     * released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to expired when it reaches its end date and time.
     * end-date-type - Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:
     * unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you explicitly cancel it.
     * limited - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time.
     * instance-match-criteria - Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:
     * open - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that have matching
     * attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances
     * that have matching attributes launch into the Capacity Reservation
     * automatically without specifying any additional parameters.
     * targeted - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching
     * attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and
     * explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only
     * permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.
