/**
 * <fullname>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</fullname>
 * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure and resizable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services Cloud.
 * Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications
 * faster. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the
 * Amazon Web Services Cloud where you can launch Amazon Web Services resources in a virtual network that you've defined. Amazon Elastic Block Store
 * (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available
 * and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance and used like a hard drive.
 * To learn more, see the following resources:
 * Amazon EC2: <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">AmazonEC2 product page, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2">Amazon EC2 documentation

     * Instance A and Instance B are successfully terminated because none of the specified

     * Instance C and Instance D fail to terminate because at least one of the specified

     * hour).
     * By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance
     * launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.
     * You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate
     * instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop it or
     * terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other
     * devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached
     * EBS volumes with the DeleteOnTermination block device mapping parameter set
