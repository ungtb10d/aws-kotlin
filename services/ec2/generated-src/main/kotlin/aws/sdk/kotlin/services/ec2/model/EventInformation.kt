     * iamFleetRoleInvalid - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet does not have the required
     * permissions either to launch or terminate an instance.
     * allLaunchSpecsTemporarilyBlacklisted - None of the configurations
     * are valid, and several attempts to launch instances have failed. For more
     * information, see the description of the event.
     * spotInstanceCountLimitExceeded - You've reached the limit on the
     * number of Spot Instances that you can launch.
     * spotFleetRequestConfigurationInvalid - The configuration is not
     * valid. For more information, see the description of the event.
     * fleetRequestChange events:
     * active - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request has been validated and Amazon EC2 is
     * attempting to maintain the target number of running instances.
     * cancelled - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is canceled and has no running
     * instances. The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet will be deleted two days after its instances are
     * terminated.
     * cancelled_running - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is canceled and does
     * not launch additional instances. Its existing instances continue to run until
     * they are interrupted or terminated. The request remains in this state until all
     * instances are interrupted or terminated.
     * cancelled_terminating - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is canceled and
     * its instances are terminating. The request remains in this state until all
     * instances are terminated.
     * expired - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request has expired. If the request was
     * created with TerminateInstancesWithExpiration set, a subsequent
     * terminated event indicates that the instances are
     * terminated.
     * modify_in_progress - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is being modified.
     * The request remains in this state until the modification is fully
     * processed.
     * modify_succeeded - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request was modified.
     * submitted - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is being evaluated and Amazon EC2
     * is preparing to launch the target number of instances.
     * progress - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is in the process of being fulfilled.
     * instanceChange events:
     * launched - A new instance was launched.
     * terminated - An instance was terminated by the user.
     * termination_notified - An instance termination notification was
     * sent when a Spot Instance was terminated by Amazon EC2 during scale-down, when the target
     * capacity of the fleet was modified down, for example, from a target capacity of
     * 4 to a target capacity of 3.
     * Information events:
     * fleetProgressHalted - The price in every launch specification is
     * not valid because it is below the Spot price (all the launch specifications have
     * produced launchSpecUnusable events). A launch specification might
     * become valid if the Spot price changes.
     * launchSpecTemporarilyBlacklisted - The configuration is not valid
     * and several attempts to launch instances have failed. For more information, see
     * the description of the event.
     * launchSpecUnusable - The price in a launch specification is not
     * valid because it is below the Spot price.
     * registerWithLoadBalancersFailed - An attempt to register
     * instances with load balancers failed. For more information, see the description
     * of the event.
